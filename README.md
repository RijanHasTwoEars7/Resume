# Resume
My resume in typst, could be your too (: !

This code-base was heavily inspired by [this repo](https://github.com/jskherman/imprecv) from [jskherman](https://github.com/jskherman). 

Ever since I was introduced to LaTeX, I had an idea in the back of my mind: a resume setup that separates the information from the typesetting code. Due to various reasons, I was unable to achieve this in LaTeX, but in this repo, I have realized my idea.

Using the code in this repo, you can easily update your resume. The information stays in the YAML file, and the code stays in the typ file. The code and data are structured with an eye towards reusability, extensibility, and readability.

Not perfect, but very usable. I'm happy to receive feedback to make it even better.
