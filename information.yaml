Projects:
  -
    Name: IAA pipeline refactor, optimization and transition
    Start: October 2023
    End: December 2023
    Highlights:
      - Refactored an inter-disciplinary novel untargeted LCMS R/Python pipeline with circa 4k lines of code.
      - Optimized the codebase to be at least a few thousand times faster.
      - Refactoring lead to the codebase becoming more readible, ergonomic, re-useable and scalable.
      - Moved the pipeline from a local SLURM cluster to AWS. 
  -
    Name: Genomic Changes associated with heterospory.
    Start: January 2023
    End: July 2024
    Highlights:
      - Trained for basic and applied science under two experienced academic scientists, learning both novel and established methodologies related to plant evolutionary genomics.
      - Literary deep dives, data search, data analysis and reuseable/efficient programming.
      - Collaborative scientific research, presentation, documentation and scientific writing.
      - Led to the submission of pre-print (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.23.604804) and currently pursuing publication.
